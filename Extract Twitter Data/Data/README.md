## Tweets Gathering

1. As we collected the twitter data from 23/05/2020 to 05/06/2020 using the relevant tags, we saved the data csv file. Then for further analysis, we have to gather the data in one csv file for effective preprocessing of data.

2. We have to deal with three particular features namely as **Tweets, tweet_date and user_location** for informative data visualization.

3. We gathered the complete twitter data into one data csv file named as **IBM_SA_Tweets.csv** and ready to proceed with the data file for sentiment analysis.
